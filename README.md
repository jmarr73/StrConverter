# StrConverter
Input text, convert it to a list and output that information into Decimal and Hexadecimal.

I made this tool to quickly convert ASCII text and turn it into decimal and hexadecimal. Comma separated with no spaces between the commas and characters.

My specific use case, a CtF challenge that involved passing a payload ASCII string value via an encoded URL. to a victim machine. I was able to convert the ASCII text to decimal value (comma delimited with no spaces in between).
